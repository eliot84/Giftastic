# Giftastic

## What is this?

Hi, Thanks for checking out my project. This is a basic excercise in working with API's. In this case I am using the Giphy API. Giftastic was made with basic HTML, CSS, JS, Ajax and Jquery.

## Purpose

The purpose of this excercise is to explore different aspects of JS programming including functions, arrays, multidimensional arrays, ajax if else statements, jquery and using Api's. More specifically, I am avoiding the use of global variables by using an object with all parameters and methods that I call on in my logic.js file.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the repository and open the index.html page in a web browser.

## Further Help

If further help is needed, do not hesitate to get in contact with me.  :-)

## Contributers

Just me for now, but feel free to join in on the fun!
